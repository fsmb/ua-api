This information includes the following:

- Available reports in the NPDB report.
- Date of the report.

Refer to [NpdbReport](../docs/definitions/npdb/npdb-report.md) for all the available fields and more information on how NPDB works.

The NPDB report information is only available when a physician submits an FCVS application to the board and the board has authorized FSMB to query NPDB on their behalf.
